# Cinema

#### A WordPress plugin to manage custom post types and fields for an independent movie house.

_**Note:** This plugin is in a fairly early state of development, including this README!_

##### Allows the admin to manage:
* movies
* film series
* directors
* formats
* posters and other images
* showtimes

## Installation
For now, download a zip of this plugin, and install it as a WordPress plugin by uploading the zip file 
from your WordPress site's Plugins page, or expand and move the plugin folder into your WordPress 
installation's plugins directory. 

## Usage
At the moment, this plugin is only useful in conjunction with my cinema theme, but I will 
be adding all necessaary template files (and a default style sheet) in future releases.
